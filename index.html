      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker provides customers with the opportunity to use containers to develop their applications.  The use of containers helps developers create applications more efficiently by using a standardized structure that is stored in each container. With the virtualization of an applicationâ€™s basic structure, users of Docker will be able to send it to people on different platforms in a faster and more reliable way. 

Without Docker or the use of containers it would take developers more time and money to create different versions of their applications that would operate correctly for each platform.
