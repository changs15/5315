      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker provides customers with the opportunity to use containers to develop and deploy their applications. The use of containers helps developers create applications more efficiently by using a standardized structure that is stored in each container. What is required to run the application is all conveniently located within the container. With the virtualization of the basic structure an application, users of Docker will be able to send it to people on different platforms in a faster and more reliable way. Without Docker or the use of containers it would take developers more time and money to create different versions of their applications that would operate correctly for each platform. </p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is a software that provides many features that developers need to produce an efficient and successful application. Some of the services they provide to customers include web serving, load balancing, microservices, cloud computing, API gateway and security. Nginx is available to the public (open source) as well, so it makes it easier for developers to change coding for their application when necessary. </p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>When someone uses a virtual machine (VM) that person will be able to access an operating system without having to be at the physical location of the hardware. This can be very helpful for users who want to operate multiple systems at once on the same computer. The resources on the local host will be allocated to the different virtual machines, which means that the user will be using their resources efficiently. An interesting feature is that software from the virtualized machine will not affect or change anything on the local device. </p>
        <p>Before the creation of virtual machines, people who wanted to use a specific operating system had to physically be at the machine. Having to be at each physical location could slow down the productivity and process of development of the application.  </p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean offers a cloud computing service through virtual machines that they call droplets. They come in a variety of sizes and prices that users can choose from based on their application needs. These virtual machines are very important for developers who want to access and make changes to their applications wherever they are. DigitalOcean is able to provide cloud computing service in an accessible and efficient way to their customers. </p>
      <p>They also have other features like Block Storage Volumes and Spaces that help increase storage capabilities of their virtual machine. Both of these features allow more flexibility in the application because developers do not have to worry about not having enough storage when they are creating or expanding their application. </p>
