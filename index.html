      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker provides customers with the opportunity to use containers to develop and deploy their applications.  The use of containers helps developers create applications more efficiently by using a standardized structure that is stored in each container. What is required to run the application is all conveniently located within the container. With the virtualization of the basic structure an application, users of Docker will be able to send it to people on different platforms in a faster and more reliable way. Without Docker or the use of containers it would take developers more time and money to create different versions of their applications that would operate correctly for each platform. </p>
